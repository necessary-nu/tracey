# Tracey Specification

## Introduction

Tracey maintains traceability between specifications and code. Specs, implementations, and tests drift apart—code changes without updating specs, specs describe unimplemented features, tests cover different scenarios than requirements specify.

Tracey uses lightweight annotations in markdown and source code comments to link specification requirements with implementing code, tests, and dependencies. This enables:

- Verifying multiple implementations (different languages, platforms) match the same spec
- Finding which requirements lack implementation or tests
- Seeing which requirement justifies each piece of code
- Analyzing impact when requirements or code changes

This document has two parts: **Language** (annotation syntax) and **Tooling** (tracey implementation).

## Nomenclature

To avoid confusion, we define these terms precisely and use them consistently:

**Specification** (or **spec**)
A set of requirements, typically written as a human-readable document.

**Requirement** (or **req**)
A single, positive (MUST, not MUST NOT) property of the system that is both implementable and testable. Each requirement should describe one specific behavior or constraint.

**Implementation**
Code that fulfills a requirement's behavior or constraint.

**Test**
Code that verifies an implementation correctly fulfills a requirement, typically containing assertions run by a test harness.

**Important distinctions:**
- A **spec** is a document containing requirements. **Tests** are executable code. Don't use "spec" to mean "test file" (as some test frameworks do).
- Other projects may use "rule" to mean requirement. We don't use that term—use "requirement" or "req" instead.

---

# Language

This section specifies the annotation language: how to define requirements in markdown specifications and reference them in source code.

## Requirement Definitions in Markdown

Requirements are defined in markdown specification documents using the syntax `PREFIX[REQ]` where PREFIX is the spec's configured prefix and REQ is a requirement ID.

### Markdown Requirement Syntax

> r[markdown.syntax.marker]
> A requirement definition MUST be written as `PREFIX[REQ]` in one of two contexts: as a standalone paragraph starting at column 0, or inside a blockquote. The PREFIX identifies which spec this requirement belongs to (configured via `prefix` in the spec configuration). The VERB is implicitly "define" in markdown (unlike source code which uses explicit verbs like `r[impl REQ]`).
>
> Valid (standalone):
> ```markdown
> r[auth.token.validation]
> The system must validate tokens before granting access.
> ```
>
> Valid (in blockquote for multi-paragraph content):
> ```markdown
> > r[api.error.format]
> > API errors must follow this format:
> >
> > ```json
> > {"error": "message", "code": 400}
> > ```
> ```

> r[markdown.syntax.inline-ignored]
> Requirement markers that appear inline within other text MUST be treated as regular text, not requirement definitions.
>
> Valid (defines requirement):
> ```markdown
> r[database.connection]
> When connecting to the database...
> ```
>
> Invalid (treated as text, not a definition):
> ```markdown
> When implementing r[database.connection] you should...
> ```

### Duplicate Detection

> r[markdown.duplicates.same-file]
> If the same requirement ID appears multiple times in a single markdown file, an error MUST be reported.
>
> Invalid:
> ```markdown
> r[auth.validation]
> Users must authenticate.
>
> Later in the same file...
>
> r[auth.validation]
> This causes an error - duplicate requirement ID!
> ```

> r[markdown.duplicates.cross-file]
> If the same requirement ID appears in multiple markdown files within the same spec, an error MUST be reported when merging manifests. Requirement IDs only need to be unique within a single spec; different specs may use the same requirement ID since they have different prefixes.
>
> Invalid (same spec):
> ```markdown
> # docs/spec/auth.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> API responses must use JSON.
>
> # docs/spec/api.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> Error - this requirement ID is already defined in auth.md within the same spec!
> ```
>
> Valid (different specs):
> ```markdown
> # docs/tracey/spec.md (tracey spec, prefix "r")
> r[api.format]
> API responses must use JSON.
>
> # vendor/messaging-spec/spec.md (messaging spec, prefix "m")
> m[api.format]
> OK - different spec, different prefix, no conflict.
> ```

## Requirement References in Source Code

Requirement references are extracted from source code comments using the syntax `PREFIX[VERB REQ]` where PREFIX matches a configured spec's prefix.

### Basic Syntax

r[ref.syntax.brackets]
A requirement reference MUST be written as `PREFIX[VERB REQ]` within a comment, where PREFIX identifies which spec is being referenced (matching the `prefix` field in the spec configuration).

> r[ref.syntax.verb]
> VERB indicates the relationship type (impl, verify, depends, related).
> 
> If omitted, defaults to `impl`.

> r[ref.syntax.req-id]
> REQ is a requirement ID consisting of dot-separated segments.
>
> Each segment MUST contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens, or underscores. This restriction ensures requirement IDs work cleanly in URLs without encoding issues.

> r[ref.syntax.surrounding-text]
> The annotation MAY be surrounded by other text within the comment. Any characters (including punctuation) after the closing `]` are ignored by the parser.
>
> Valid:
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth.token.validation]       // tracey spec (prefix "r")
> // r[verify user-profile.update_email] // tracey spec
> // m[depends crypto_v2.algorithm]      // messaging spec (prefix "m")
> // h2[impl api.v1.users]               // http2 spec (prefix "h2")
> // r[message.hello.timing]: send Hello immediately
> // See r[auth.requirements] for details.
> ```
>
> Invalid:
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth..token]           // empty segment
> // r[verify user.profile!update] // exclamation mark not allowed
> // r[depends .crypto.algorithm]  // leading dot
> // r[impl api.users.]            // trailing dot
> // r[verify user profile.update] // space not allowed
> // r[impl auth.🔐.token]         // emoji not allowed
> // r[verify café.menu]           // accented characters not allowed
> ```

### Supported Verbs

Source code references use verbs to indicate the relationship between code and requirements:

> r[ref.verb.impl]
> The `impl` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating that the code implements the referenced requirement.
>
> ```rust
> // r[impl auth.token.validation]
> fn validate_token(token: &str) -> bool {
>     // etc.
> }
> ```

> r[ref.verb.verify]
> The `verify` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating that the code tests or verifies the referenced requirement.
>
> ```typescript
> test('token validation', () => {
>     // r[verify auth.token.validation]
>     expect(validateToken('abc')).toBe(true);
> });
> ```

> r[ref.verb.depends]
> The `depends` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating a strict dependency — the code must be rechecked if the referenced requirement changes.
>
> ```python
> # r[depends auth.crypto.algorithm]
> # This code must be reviewed if the crypto algorithm changes
> def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
>     return bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
> ```

> r[ref.verb.related]
> The `related` verb MUST be interpreted as indicating a loose connection, shown when reviewing related code.
>
> ```swift
> // r[related user.session.timeout]
> // Session cleanup is related to timeout requirements
> func cleanupExpiredSessions() {
>     sessions.removeAll { $0.isExpired }
> }
> ```

> r[ref.verb.default]
> When no verb is provided, the reference SHOULD be treated as an `impl` reference.
>
> ```go
> // r[auth.token.validation] - no verb, defaults to 'impl'
> func ValidateToken(token string) bool {
>     return len(token) > 0
> }
> ```

### Comment Types

r[ref.comments.line]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in line comments (`//`, `#`, etc. depending on language).

r[ref.comments.block]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in block comments (`/* */`, `""" """`, etc. depending on language).

r[ref.comments.doc]
Requirement references MUST be recognized in documentation comments (`///`, `//!`, `/** */`, etc. depending on language).

### Source Location Tracking

r[ref.span.offset]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the byte offset of its location in the source file.

r[ref.span.length]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the byte length of the reference.

r[ref.span.file]
Each extracted requirement reference MUST include the path to the source file.

---

# Tooling

This section specifies how the tracey tool processes annotations, computes coverage, and exposes results.

## Coverage Computation

r[coverage.compute.percentage]
Coverage percentage MUST be calculated as (covered requirements / total requirements) * 100.

r[coverage.compute.covered]
Tracey MUST consider a requirement covered if at least one reference to it exists in the scanned source files.

r[coverage.compute.uncovered]
Requirements in the manifest with no references MUST be reported as uncovered.

r[coverage.compute.invalid]
References to requirement IDs not present in the manifest MUST be reported as invalid.

## Reference Extraction

r[ref.verb.unknown]
When an unrecognized verb is encountered, tracey MUST emit a warning but SHOULD still extract the requirement reference.

r[ref.prefix.unknown]
When a reference uses a prefix that does not match any configured spec, tracey MUST report an error indicating the unknown prefix and list the available spec prefixes.

r[ref.prefix.matching]
When extracting references from source code, tracey MUST match the prefix against configured specs to determine which spec's requirement namespace to query.

## Cross-Workspace Implementation References

r[ref.cross-workspace.paths]
Implementation references MAY be located in different crates or workspaces outside the primary project structure.

> r[ref.cross-workspace.path-resolution]
> When resolving file paths for implementation references, tracey MUST resolve relative paths from the workspace root (the directory where tracey is invoked or where the configuration file is located).
>
> Example: If bearmark is at `../bearmark` relative to the tracey workspace, implementation files in bearmark would be referenced as `../bearmark/src/reqs.rs`.

> r[ref.cross-workspace.missing-paths]
> When an implementation file path does not exist on the filesystem, tracey MUST continue functioning but MUST emit warnings indicating the missing path.

> r[ref.cross-workspace.cli-warnings]
> Missing implementation file paths MUST be reported in CLI output when running commands like `tracey status`, `tracey_uncovered`, or other tools that access implementation data.
>
> Example warning format:
> ```
> Warning: Implementation file not found: ../bearmark/src/reqs.rs
>   Referenced by spec 'tracey' implementation 'rust'
> ```

> r[ref.cross-workspace.dashboard-warnings]
> Missing implementation file paths MUST be displayed as warnings in the dashboard UI, with visual indicators (warning badges, error states) on affected requirements or source file listings.

> r[ref.cross-workspace.graceful-degradation]
> When implementation files are missing, tracey MUST still display available data (requirement definitions, other implementations) and MUST NOT crash or fail to start.

## Markdown Processing

### HTML Output

> r[markdown.html.div]
> When transforming markdown, each requirement marker MUST be replaced with a `<div>` element with class `requirement`.
>
> Input:
> ```markdown
> r[auth.token.validation]
> ```
>
> Output:
> ```html
> <div class="requirement" id="r-auth.token.validation">
>   <a href="#r-auth.token.validation">auth.<wbr>token.<wbr>validation</a>
> </div>
> ```

> r[markdown.html.anchor]
> The generated div MUST have an `id` attribute in the format `r-{req.id}` for linking.
>
> ```html
> <div class="requirement" id="r-api.response.format">
> ```

> r[markdown.html.link]
> The generated div MUST contain a link (`<a>`) pointing to its own anchor.
>
> ```html
> <a href="#r-user.login.flow">user.<wbr>login.<wbr>flow</a>
> ```

> r[markdown.html.wbr]
> Dots in the displayed requirement ID SHOULD be followed by `<wbr>` elements to allow line breaking.
>
> ```html
> database.<wbr>connection.<wbr>pool
> ```

## Configuration

r[config.format.kdl]
The configuration file MUST be in KDL format.

r[config.path.default]
The default configuration path MUST be `.config/tracey/config.kdl` relative to the project root.

> r[config.schema]
> The configuration MUST follow this schema:
>
> ```kdl
> spec {
>     name "tracey"
>     prefix "r"
>     include "docs/spec/**/*.md"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/**/*.rs"
>         exclude "target/**"
>     }
> }
>
> spec {
>     name "messaging-protocol"
>     prefix "m"
>     include "vendor/messaging-spec/**/*.md"
>     source_url "https://github.com/example/messaging-spec"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/**/*.rs"
>     }
> }
> ```

r[config.spec.name]
Each spec configuration MUST have a `name` child node with the spec name as its argument.

r[config.spec.prefix]
Each spec configuration MUST have a `prefix` child node specifying the single-character or multi-character prefix used to identify this spec in markdown and source code annotations.

r[config.spec.include]
Each spec configuration MUST have one or more `include` child nodes specifying glob patterns for markdown files containing requirement definitions.

r[config.spec.source-url]
Each spec configuration MAY have a `source_url` child node providing the canonical URL for the specification (e.g., a GitHub repository). This URL is used for attribution in the dashboard and documentation.

r[config.impl.name]
Each impl configuration MUST have a `name` child node identifying the implementation (e.g., "main", "core").

r[config.impl.include]
Each impl configuration MAY have one or more `include` child nodes specifying glob patterns for source files to scan.

r[config.impl.exclude]
Each impl configuration MAY have one or more `exclude` child nodes specifying glob patterns for source files to exclude.

### Multiple Specs and Remote Specs

r[config.multi-spec.prefix-namespace]
When multiple specs are configured, the prefix serves as the namespace to disambiguate which spec a requirement belongs to.

r[config.multi-spec.unique-within-spec]
Requirement IDs MUST be unique within a single spec, but MAY be duplicated across different specs (since they use different prefixes).

r[config.remote-spec.local-files]
Remote specifications MUST be obtained as local files before tracey can process them. Users can use git submodules, manual downloads, or any other method to obtain spec files locally.

> r[config.remote-spec.workflow]
> The recommended workflow for implementing a remote specification is:
>
> 1. Obtain the spec files locally (e.g., via git submodule or download)
> 2. Configure the spec with `include` pointing to the local files
> 3. Set `source_url` to the canonical spec location for attribution
> 4. Use the spec's configured prefix in source code annotations
>
> Example:
> ```kdl
> spec {
>     name "http2"
>     prefix "h2"
>     include "vendor/http2-spec/docs/**/*.md"
>     source_url "https://github.com/http2/spec"
>
>     impl {
>         name "rust"
>         include "crates/http2/**/*.rs"
>     }
> }
> ```

## File Walking

r[walk.gitignore]
File walking MUST respect `.gitignore` files.

r[walk.default-include]

r[dashboard.validation.display]
The dashboard MUST display validation errors prominently, with links to the problematic locations.

r[dashboard.validation.continuous]
The dashboard SHOULD run validation continuously and update the UI when new issues are detected.

### Query Tools

r[mcp.query.search]
The `tracey_search` tool MUST support keyword search across requirement text and IDs, returning matching requirements with their definitions and references.

r[mcp.query.file-reqs]
The `tracey_file_reqs` tool MUST return all requirements referenced in a specific source file, grouped by reference type (impl/verify).

r[mcp.query.priority]
The `tracey_priority` tool MUST suggest which uncovered requirements to implement next, prioritizing by section completeness and requirement dependencies.

r[dashboard.query.search]
The dashboard MUST provide a search interface for finding requirements by keyword in their text or ID.

r[dashboard.query.file-reqs]
The dashboard MUST show all requirements referenced by a specific file when viewing file details.

## Dashboard In-Browser Editing

The dashboard provides inline editing of requirements directly in the browser, enabling rapid iteration on specification documents without leaving the review interface.

### Byte Range Tracking

r[dashboard.editing.byte-range.req-span]
Each requirement definition MUST track its byte range in the source markdown file, storing both the start offset and end offset (inclusive of the requirement marker line and all content lines).

r[dashboard.editing.byte-range.marker-and-content]
The byte range MUST include the requirement marker line (`r[req.id]`) plus all following content lines until a blank line, another requirement, or a heading is encountered.

r[dashboard.editing.byte-range.attribute]
The requirement's HTML container MUST include a `data-br="start-end"` attribute containing the byte range, enabling the editor to locate and update the exact markdown source.

Example:
```html
<div class="req-container" data-br="1234-1456">
  <!-- requirement content -->
</div>
```

### Edit Badge and Activation

r[dashboard.editing.badge.display]
Each requirement MUST display an "Edit" badge in its header, styled as a low-emphasis button with a pencil icon to indicate editability without demanding attention.

r[dashboard.editing.badge.appearance]
The Edit badge MUST use muted colors (gray) by default and accent colors on hover, and MUST be larger and more prominent than reference badges to make editing discoverable.

r[dashboard.editing.activation.click]
Clicking the Edit badge MUST activate inline editing mode for that requirement, replacing the rendered requirement with the inline editor.

### Copy Requirement ID

r[dashboard.editing.copy.button]
Each requirement MUST display a "Copy" button or icon in its header that copies the requirement ID to the clipboard when clicked.

r[dashboard.editing.copy.format]
The copy button MUST copy only the requirement ID (e.g., `dashboard.editing.copy.button`) without any prefix or brackets, ready for use in implementation references.

r[dashboard.editing.copy.feedback]
After copying, the button MUST provide visual feedback (e.g., brief color change, checkmark icon, or "Copied!" tooltip) to confirm the action succeeded.

### Implementation Preview Modal

r[dashboard.impl-preview.modal]
When viewing the specification tab and clicking on an implementation reference badge, the dashboard MUST open a modal showing the source code without navigating away from the spec tab.

r[dashboard.impl-preview.scroll-highlight]
The implementation preview modal MUST automatically scroll to the referenced line number and highlight it for easy identification.

r[dashboard.impl-preview.open-in-sources]
The modal MUST include an "Open in sources" button that navigates to the full sources view when clicked, allowing users to see more context or make edits.

r[dashboard.impl-preview.stay-in-spec]
Clicking an implementation reference badge MUST NOT automatically switch to the sources tab - it MUST show the preview modal while keeping the user in the specification view.

r[dashboard.impl-preview.rationale]
The preview modal allows quick inspection of implementation code without losing context in the specification, reducing cognitive load when reviewing how requirements are implemented.

### Inline Editor Interface

r[dashboard.editing.inline.fullwidth]
The inline editor MUST display as a full-width editor showing only the markdown source, replacing the entire requirement block during editing.

r[dashboard.editing.inline.vim-mode]
The editor MUST support vim keybindings via CodeMirror's vim extension, with a visible "VIM" indicator in the editor header.

r[dashboard.editing.inline.codemirror]
The editor MUST use CodeMirror 6 with markdown language support, providing syntax highlighting, line wrapping, and proper monospace font rendering.

r[dashboard.editing.inline.header]
The editor header MUST display: an "Edit Requirement" label, vim mode indicator, and the source file path for context.

r[dashboard.editing.inline.dimensions]
The editor MUST have a minimum height of 300px and maximum height of 600px to accommodate short requirements while preventing excessive vertical space usage.

### Git Safety

r[dashboard.editing.git.check-required]
The dashboard MUST check if a file is in a git repository before allowing inline editing, refusing to edit files that are not tracked by git.

r[dashboard.editing.git.api]
The server MUST provide a `GET /api/check-git?path=X` endpoint that returns `{in_git: boolean}` indicating whether the specified file is within a git repository.

r[dashboard.editing.git.error-message]
When a user attempts to edit a file not in a git repository, the dashboard MUST display a clear error message: "This file is not in a git repository. Tracey requires git for safe editing."

r[dashboard.editing.git.rationale]
Git requirement provides a safety net for inline editing: users can review changes with `git diff`, revert mistakes with `git checkout`, and maintain edit history without additional undo/redo implementation.

### Byte Range Operations

r[dashboard.editing.api.fetch-range]
The server MUST provide a `GET /api/file-range?path=X&start=N&end=M` endpoint that returns the exact bytes from the specified range as UTF-8 text, along with a BLAKE3 hash of the entire file.

r[dashboard.editing.api.fetch-range-response]
The fetch-range endpoint MUST return `{content: string, start: number, end: number, file_hash: string}` where `file_hash` is the hexadecimal BLAKE3 hash of the entire file contents.

r[dashboard.editing.api.update-range]
The server MUST provide a `PATCH /api/file-range` endpoint accepting `{path, start, end, content, file_hash}` that replaces the specified byte range with new content only if the file hash matches.

r[dashboard.editing.api.update-range-response]
The update-range endpoint MUST return `{content: string, start: number, end: number, file_hash: string}` on success, where `file_hash` is the BLAKE3 hash of the file after the update.

r[dashboard.editing.api.hash-conflict]
If the provided `file_hash` does not match the current file's BLAKE3 hash, the server MUST return HTTP 409 Conflict with an error message indicating the file has changed since it was loaded.

r[dashboard.editing.api.range-validation]
The byte range endpoints MUST validate that `start < end` and `end <= file_length`, returning appropriate error codes for invalid ranges.

r[dashboard.editing.api.utf8-validation]
The fetch-range endpoint MUST validate that the extracted bytes form valid UTF-8 text, returning an error if the range splits a multi-byte character.

r[dashboard.editing.hash.rationale]
Hash-based conflict detection prevents race conditions where the file changes between loading the editor and saving, ensuring users don't accidentally overwrite concurrent modifications.

### Save and Cancel Workflow

r[dashboard.editing.save.patch-file]
Clicking Save MUST send a PATCH request with the new content, update the file, and close the inline editor on success.

r[dashboard.editing.save.error-handling]
Save errors MUST be displayed inline in the editor footer without closing the editor, allowing the user to retry or cancel.

r[dashboard.editing.cancel.discard]
Clicking Cancel MUST discard all changes and close the inline editor without modifying the file.

r[dashboard.editing.cancel.escape]
Pressing Escape MUST cancel editing and close the inline editor (when not in vim insert mode).

### File Watching and Reload

r[dashboard.editing.reload.auto-detect]
After a successful save, the file watcher MUST detect the change and trigger a dashboard rebuild automatically.

r[dashboard.editing.reload.live-update]
The dashboard MUST connect to the WebSocket endpoint to receive notifications of rebuilds and reload the page content when a new version is available, preserving scroll position.

r[dashboard.editing.reload.smooth]
The reload MUST be visually smooth, with no jarring page transitions or loss of context (scroll position maintained).

### Keyboard Navigation

r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.navigation]
The specification view MUST support keyboard navigation between requirements using `j` (next) and `k` (previous) keys.

> r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.next-req]
> Pressing `j` MUST scroll to and focus the next requirement in the document, wrapping to the first requirement when at the end.

> r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.prev-req]
> Pressing `k` MUST scroll to and focus the previous requirement in the document, wrapping to the last requirement when at the start.

> r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.open-editor]
> Pressing `e` MUST open the inline editor for the currently focused requirement.

> r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.visual-focus]
> The currently focused requirement MUST have a visual indicator (highlight, border, or similar) to show which requirement is active for keyboard operations.

> r[dashboard.editing.keyboard.scope]
> Keyboard shortcuts MUST only be active when not typing in an input field, textarea, or editor to avoid conflicts with normal text entry.

### Future: Add Requirement

r[dashboard.editing.add.button status=draft]
The dashboard SHOULD provide an "Add Requirement" button that inserts a new requirement template at appropriate locations (end of sections, after existing requirements).

r[dashboard.editing.add.template status=draft]
The template MUST be pre-filled as a blockquote with `r[|]` where `|` represents the cursor position, ready for the user to type the requirement ID.

Example template:
```markdown
> r[|]
>
```

r[dashboard.editing.add.cursor-position status=draft]
The cursor MUST be positioned inside the brackets after `r[` to enable immediate typing of the requirement ID, followed by tab to move to the content line.
